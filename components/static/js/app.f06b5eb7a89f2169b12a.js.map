指令会依次向当前组件 context 发送 dragstart、drag、dragend 事件，\n * 并带上拖动距离作为参数，在当前组件中可以监听这些事件：\n *\n * ```js\n * this.$on('dragstart', ({ event }) => { ... })\n * this.$on('drag', ({ event, distanceX, distanceY }) => { ... })\n * this.$on('dragend', ({ event, distanceX, distanceY }) => { ... })\n * ```\n *\n * 在各个事件的回调函数中，可以对目标 DOM 元素进行操作，从而达到拖动等效果。\n *\n * drag 指令内部也提供了一个默认的拖动处理器，借助 translate 来移动目标元素。可以通过指令的 arg\n * 指定要使用的拖动处理器（目前仅支持 translate ），通过 value 并借助 vue 的 refs 来指定目标元素：\n *\n * ```html\n * <p ref=\"target1\"></p>\n * <p ref=\"target2\"></p>\n * <div v-drag.translate=\"['target1', 'target2']\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * drag 指令也可以随时关闭 drag 功能，只需要传入值为 false 的 draggable 参数即可：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag=\"{targets: ['target1', 'target2'], type: 'translate', draggable: false}\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * 可以通过传递 containment 参数来限制拖动的范围。\n * containment 参数可以是结构为 `{ left: 0, top: 0, width: 100, height: 0}` 的对象：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag.translate=\"{targets: ['content'], type: 'translate', containment: {left: 0, top: 0, width: 100, height: 100}}\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * 也可以是一个 DOM 节点或者 ref 指向的节点：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag.translate=\"{targets: ['content'], type: 'translate', containment: body}\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * 可以通过传递 axis 参数来限定拖动的方向，x 表明在水平方向拖动，y 表示在垂直方向拖动：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag.translate=\"{targets: ['content'], type: 'translate', axis: 'x', ready: (handle) => { ... }}\"></div>\n * ```\n * `ready` 参数是一个回调函数，当 drag 指令准备就绪后会调用该函数，并传回一个句柄 `handle` ，句柄上提供了 `reset` 方法，可以将 targets 元素\n * 的视觉重置为 drag 之前的的效果。\n *\n * drag 指令的复杂参数可以通过 `value` 的方式传递，在一些简单场景下，也可以通过 modifier 、 arg 传递参数：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag:ref1,ref2.translate.x=\"{...}\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * 其中，`ref1,ref2` 对应 targets 参数， `translate` 对应 type 参数， `x` 对应 axis 参数。\n *\n * drag 指令也支持自定义 Handler ：\n *\n * ```js\n * import BaseHandler from 'veui/directives/drag/BaseHandler'\n *\n * export default class CustomHandler extends BaseHandler {\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * 然后将自定义 Handler 注册到 drag 中去：\n *\n * ```js\n * import { registerHandler } from 'veui/directives/drag'\n *\n * registerHandler('customHandler', CustomHandler)\n * ```\n *\n * 在使用的时候，就可以把 type 参数设置为 `customHandler` 了：\n *\n * ```html\n * <div v-drag.translate=\"{targets: ['content'], type: 'customHandler', axis: 'x'\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * **注：** 自定义 Handler 必须继承自 `BaseHandler` 。\n */\nexport default {\n  inserted: refresh,\n  componentUpdated: refresh,\n  unbind: clear\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/directives/drag.js","import Vue from 'vue'\nimport
